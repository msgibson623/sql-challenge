Marcus's Assignment 9

Description: I am tasked with doing a research project about people whom the company, Pewlett Hackard, employed during the 1980s and 1990s.
My first task was to create tables for the six remaining csv files. Attached is a sketch from QuickDBD from table structure.  
Imported each csv file into a corespong SQL table. I also answered some specific questions requested by the company. 
I used SQL pgAdmin4.
